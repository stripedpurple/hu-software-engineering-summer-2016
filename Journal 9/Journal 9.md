## Chapter 17 - Component-based software engineering

​	Component-based software engineering (CBSE) is a reuse oriented way of creating related components in a system.

### 17.1 Components and component models

​	"A component is a software unit whose functionality and dependencies are completely defined by a set of public interfaces. " (Sommerville) Because components are independent of each other they can be used together without know how one another is implemented. Components can be sourced from a program internally, or from an external service

A component model defines standards for components, implementation, documentation, & deployment. The component model stands to provide a common interface between components, & easy communication across application & services.

### 17.2 CBSE processes

​	CBSE processes are software processes designed to be component based & reuse oriented. Originally CBSE was thought to be the next big market in the software industry, however this vision has yet to come to fruition. Most CBSE is done at the organization level, completed internally by a companies development team. When attempting to work with CBSE & reuse, a rigorous strutted approach to development is required. A conscious effort to identify & develop reusable code must be made.

### 17.3 Component composition

Component composition is the processor integrating multiple competes together, using glue code, with the end goal being the creation of a new component or applications. Occasionally, while implementing components, a developer may run into some compatibility issues. Glue code is an adaptor that helps fix these incompatibility. Compositions can be constrained by the requirements set out during Requirements Engineering. To accommodate time, cost, functional, & non-functional requirements some trade-offs must be made in the component composition decision.
