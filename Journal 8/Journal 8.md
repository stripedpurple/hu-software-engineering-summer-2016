## Chapter 16 - Software Reuse

​	Most development done today is done so by reusing knowledge and code from previously projects. There is a veritable cornucopia of different ways to reuse software. Reuse ranges from classes and methods to complete applications. This can be seen in my application with use of the express framework, or other company created libraries.

Software reuse leads to lower costs, faster development, and lower risks. System architecture becomes more reliable. Developers can work more effectively, focusing on the design of reusable code. This is less so when studying my application

### 16.1 The Reuse Landscape 

​	Reuse is highly variable landscape, greatly dependent on the people involved, the customer requirements, & the time frame for the project.

### 16.2 Application Frameworks 

​	Application frameworks are collections of software components, functions, & other applications designed to be highly reusable. Application frameworks also provide a system architecture through use of design patterns. Application frameworks can be classified in three ways, system infrastructure frameworks, middleware integration frameworks, & enterprise application frameworks.

An example of a frame would be the express js framework which can be seen in my application.

### 16.3 Software Product Lines 

​	Software product lines are collection of related applications developed from one or more code base. Each application in the collection is then specialized from the code base. Companies often create application product lines as they grow. The application I  create derives its root in a BioHiTech modified version of the express framework designed to fit in with other applications in the BioHiTech Eco system.  

### 16.4 Cots Product Reuse

COTS  (Commercial Off The Shelf) product reuse is concerned with the reuse of large-scale, off-the-shelf system, providing a large set of functionality.  COTS can dramatically reduce the costs and time of development. When using a COTS-based some issues may be encountered, such as control over functionality and performance, inability to control system evolution, and external support.
